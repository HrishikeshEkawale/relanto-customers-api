#relanto-customers-api

Overview: The Customer Management API is a MuleSoft-based integration project designed to facilitate the management of customer data. This API will expose two main endpoints, GET and POST, enabling users to retrieve customer information and create new customer records respectively. It aims to provide a seamless and scalable solution for handling customer data with minimal overhead.

Key Features:

GET /customers:

This endpoint retrieves a list of customer details from the system. The response will include basic information about each customer (such as name, email, and address).
It will allow filtering by specific customer attributes (e.g., customer ID, name) to enable more refined queries.
Supports pagination for large datasets, improving performance by delivering data in manageable chunks.
POST /customers:

This endpoint allows the creation of a new customer record. Users can send a JSON payload containing the customer's details (e.g., name, email, phone, and address).
The system will validate the input data, ensuring that required fields are provided, and that data is formatted correctly before being persisted to the database.
The response will confirm the successful creation of the customer and provide a unique customer ID for reference.
Functionalities:

Data Validation: Ensures that the required fields are provided and valid. This includes checks for correct data types, mandatory fields, and format validation (e.g., valid email addresses).
Error Handling: The API will return appropriate HTTP status codes and detailed error messages for scenarios such as invalid input data, missing fields, or server errors.
Data Security: All endpoints will ensure that customer data is transmitted securely, with support for HTTPS and any required authentication mechanisms (e.g., API keys, OAuth).
Use Cases:

Retrieving Customer Information: Client applications (e.g., web portals, mobile apps) can use the GET /customers endpoint to display or process customer data.
Creating New Customers: Businesses or systems that need to add new customers can utilize the POST /customers endpoint to automatically insert customer records into the system.
Technical Stack:

MuleSoft Anypoint Platform: Mule ESB for integration, API Management for securing and monitoring the API.
Database: A database system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to store customer data.
JSON: For structuring request and response payloads.
Benefits:

Centralized Customer Data Management: Provides a unified interface for retrieving and creating customer records, ensuring data consistency and reducing the complexity of managing customer data across systems.
Scalability: The API can easily scale to handle an increasing number of customers or requests.
Flexibility: Can be extended with additional endpoints and features (e.g., PUT/PATCH for updates, DELETE for removals) as needed.
This Customer Management API will simplify the process of interacting with customer data, making it easy for applications and systems to retrieve and store customer information efficiently.
